# Napier2.0
A Mathematics Bot for Discord educational chat servers.

# Setup
While I doubt anyone would run this out of there own volition, there is a way to set this up:

Step 1:
clone this repository

Step 2:
Get a key for a new bot from the "My Apps" section of the https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me website

Step 3: 
Put the key in the token sections of the start.py file 

Step 4:
Since automatic channel management is not implemented, you are also going to have to add your channel ID to the ranking\_config.ini
